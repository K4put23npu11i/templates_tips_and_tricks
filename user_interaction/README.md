# User interaction
Sometimes the program needs input from the user to exactly know what to do. 
Or if the program includes more functionality and the user needs to choose. 
These user inputs can be managed either by command line interaction or with a gui.
Here you can find a collection of functions and code snippet for user interaction with the program.
## What is it?
- cmd line - ask user for input (free text)
- cmd line - ask user to choose from given values
- cmd line - shutdown pc if user does not interact
- tkinter - collection of statements for creating a gui

## How does it work?
The functions uses some libraries or standard Python functions to perform the actions.
